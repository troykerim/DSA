    leetcode 703 - Kth largest element in a stream
    You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the kth highest test score from applicants in real-time. 
    This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

    You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer k, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the kth highest test score after a new score has been submitted. 
    More specifically, we are looking for the kth highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

    Implement the KthLargest class:

    KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of test scores nums.
    int add(int val) Adds a new test score val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k, nums):
        self.minHeap = nums
        self.k = k 
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        
    def add(self, val):
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
